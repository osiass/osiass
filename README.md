## About Me

I develop **end-to-end AI-powered systems**, covering the full lifecycle from
data processing and model integration to scalable backend services and mobile applications.

My main focus areas are:
- Applied **Machine Learning & AI systems**
- **Backend development** with Python & Django (REST, ASGI, real-time pipelines)
- **Mobile application development** with Flutter
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and intelligent data pipelines

I am currently building Ozetle, an AI-driven educational platform that transforms raw educational content into structured, interactive learning materials.

## Featured Project – EduSum (AI Learning Assistant)

EduSum is a **full-stack AI learning system** designed for high school–level education.

### System Overview

- **AI Reasoning Layer:**  
  - Google Gemini 2.5 Flash optimized for low-latency, short-form educational responses
- **RAG Engine:**  
  - FAISS-based multilingual vector search
  - Subject-aware re-ranking (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, etc.)
  - Hybrid retrieval with semantic + keyword-based guarantees
- **Data Quality Pipeline:**  
  - DistilBERT + Random Forest classifier to filter non-educational content
  - TF-IDF–based subject classification for context weighting
- **Backend Architecture:**  
  - Django-based REST services with ASGI support
  - Custom middleware for rate limiting, logging, and security
  - Secure production exposure via Cloudflare Tunnel (HTTPS)
- **Mobile Application:**  
  - Flutter-based client with persistent chat history, PDF scanning, and media handling

### Optional Voice Interaction Module

EduSum also includes an **optional voice interaction layer**:
- Speech-to-text input
- AI response generation via RAG
- Text-to-speech output using Coqui XTTS v2  
This module is designed as an extension, not a dependency of the core system.
